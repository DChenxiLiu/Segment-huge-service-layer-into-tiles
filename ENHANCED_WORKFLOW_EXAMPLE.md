# ENHANCED WATERLOO 2025 WORKFLOW EXAMPLE

## üöÄ Complete Automated Workflow

The enhanced workflow now includes **automatic training polygon generation**, making it a complete end-to-end solution for distributed supervised classification.

### **What's New:**
- ‚úÖ **Step 3: Auto-generate training polygons** for each section
- ‚úÖ **Hexagonal sampling pattern** with selectable sizes (5m, 10m, 15m)
- ‚úÖ **Smart polygon distribution** (150-300 per section based on area)
- ‚úÖ **Ready-to-label polygons** for immediate team distribution

---

## üìã Complete Workflow Steps

### **Step 1: Boundary Masking (Required)**
- Creates boundary polygon to exclude blank/NoData areas
- Essential for irregular imagery shapes
- Optimizes processing efficiency

### **Step 2: Geographic Sectioning**
- Divides imagery into team-sized sections (4-8 recommended)
- Each section becomes independent work unit
- Balanced areas for fair team distribution

### **Step 3: Training Polygon Generation (NEW!)**
- **Automatically generates** training polygons for each section
- **User selects polygon size:**
  - Small (5m) - Detailed classification
  - Medium (10m) - Balanced approach  
  - Large (15m) - Broad classification
- **Optimal sampling strategy:**
  - 70% grid-based (systematic coverage)
  - 30% random (additional coverage)
- **Area-based count:** Larger sections get more polygons

### **Step 4: Section Export (Optional)**
- Downloads raster data for offline work
- Each section typically 100-500 MB
- Can skip for web service direct access

### **Step 5: Project Summary**
- Creates documentation with team assignments
- Lists all generated files and locations
- Provides step-by-step instructions for team

## üéØ Example Run Output

```
WATERLOO REGION 2025 IMAGERY CLASSIFICATION WORKFLOW
============================================================

STEP 1: CREATE BOUNDARY MASK
========================================
Creating boundary mask to exclude NoData/blank areas...
‚úÖ Boundary ready: /project/boundaries/waterloo_2025_boundary.shp
‚úÖ Blank areas will be excluded from processing

STEP 2: CREATE CLASSIFICATION SECTIONS
========================================
How many team members will work on classification? (recommended: 4-6): 5
Creating 5 sections for distributed classification...
‚úÖ Sections created: /project/sections/waterloo_sections.shp

STEP 3: GENERATE TRAINING POLYGONS
========================================
Training polygon options:
1. Small (5m hexagons) - For detailed classification
2. Medium (10m hexagons) - Balanced approach
3. Large (15m hexagons) - For broad classification
Select polygon size (1-3): 2

Generating 10m hexagonal training polygons for each section...
‚úÖ Training polygons generated successfully!
üìÅ Training data folder: /project/training_data/
  section_01_training: 203 polygons
  section_02_training: 187 polygons
  section_03_training: 245 polygons
  section_04_training: 198 polygons
  section_05_training: 221 polygons
üìä Total training polygons: 1,054

STEP 4: EXPORT SECTION RASTERS (OPTIONAL)
========================================
Export section rasters now? (y/n): n

STEP 5: PROJECT SUMMARY
========================================
‚úÖ Project summary saved: /project/documentation/project_summary.txt

üéâ WORKFLOW SETUP COMPLETE!

## üë• Team Member Instructions

Each team member receives:

### **Files for Each Section:**
```
section_01/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ section_01_boundary.shp      # Section area boundary
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ training_data/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ section_01_training.shp  # Pre-generated training polygons
```

### **Team Member Tasks:**
1. **Open ArcGIS Pro** with the project
2. **Add imagery layer** (web service or local)
3. **Load their section boundary** and training polygons
4. **Label training polygons** by land cover class:
   - Urban
   - Forest
   - Agriculture
   - Water
   - etc.
5. **Run supervised classification** (Maximum Likelihood, Random Forest, etc.)
6. **Export classified raster** for their section
7. **Return results** for final mosaic combination

## üîß Technical Benefits

### **Time Savings:**
- **Training polygon creation:** ~2-3 hours ‚Üí **5 minutes** (automated)
- **Setup consistency:** All sections use same methodology
- **Quality assurance:** Systematic sampling ensures good coverage

### **Team Efficiency:**
- **Ready-to-start:** Team members get pre-generated polygons
- **Consistent workflow:** Everyone follows same process
- **Faster delivery:** Reduced setup time means faster results

### **Quality Control:**
- **Optimal sampling:** Grid+random strategy proven effective
- **Balanced coverage:** Each section gets appropriate polygon density
- **Boundary compliance:** All polygons within actual imagery areas

## üöÄ How to Run

### **In ArcGIS Pro Python Window:**
```python
import os
os.chdir(r"/path/to/your/scripts")

# Run the complete enhanced workflow
exec(open('waterloo_classification_workflow.py').read())

# Follow the interactive prompts:
# 1. Choose your 2025 data source (web service or local)
# 2. Workflow automatically creates boundaries
# 3. Choose number of team members
# 4. Select training polygon size
# 5. Optionally export section rasters
# 6. Get complete project ready for team distribution
```
